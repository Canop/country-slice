# country-slice

My small weekend project, written in Bevy Engine. Still active **WIP**! Making it public early in case someone might find this  example of using Bevy for simple proc stuff useful

To run it, compile with `cargo run --release` and move the `target\release\country-slice.exe` into root folder, otherwise the assets will be missing.
